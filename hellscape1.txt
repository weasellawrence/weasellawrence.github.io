Hellscape

Buckbear Hellscape is the plan of creating a planet for industrial purpose only. It will serve as a factory planet. It is still in very early stages of planning.

Update: The main developments in the Hellscape project are in the field of creating the planet itself. However, it has been identified that it will be easier to exterminate a species that we had previously enslaved and geo-engineer the landscape to fit our purposes. Currently, we are leaning towards Planet Trump 2.0, as it is the main planet for creation currently and is in the middle of our system. 

Update: Planet Trump 2.0 has been chosen, and a chemical weapon has been tested and cleared for use to start the extermination. We call this chemical weapon a farmbomb, and we will destroy thier food source with it. After that, we will blow up the surface with some <50 megaton nuclear bombs.

Update: Extermination finished. We are now working on covering the entire planet in a sheet of metal. We are likely to use steal, as it is strong, flexible and cheap. 

Update: The metal sheet is done. We are working on the foundations of the factories. We have made a factory design that is incredibly customizable and flexible to our needs. They are very versatile because we can switch our their production lines. We are also working on importing slaves from Zorg. We will likely require about 10,000,000,000 Zorgian Slaves. 

Update: The Hellscape project has been finished. We are fully focused on producing war robots, tanks, aircraft, and other weapons and war machines.
