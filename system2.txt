Introduction
We at Buckbear work to maximize efficiency and safety, so these systematic protocols have been implemented.

Security System
Several clearance levels are allowing the viewing of documents and objects. 
Level 0: Anybody in public can see this information. Aliens only have level 0 clearance.
Level 1: All human employees and visitors have level 1 clearance. 
Level 2: Most human employees can access level 2 clearance with a reason, but permission must be granted by a person with level 3 or higher. Nobody outside the company can have level 2 clearance. 
Level 3: Human Employee supervisors, scientists, and people at this same level have level 3 clearance. 
Level 4: Human Employees with 20 or more subordinates have level 4 clearance.
Level 5: Employees that often need to converse and interact with the owner have level 5 clearance. The minimum for level 5 is 12 visits to the owner a year. 
Level 6: Human employees at the top of their section of the company have level 6 clearance, such as the head treasurer or head factory managers. 
Level 7: Only the owner and any human who has gotten permission from him/her have level 7 clearance. 
Security personnel
For security at each factory, there are 3 infantry divisions and 1 armored division. A total of around 66,000 men, 350 tanks, and 420 armored cars. There is also a navy/air force/space force that consists of 100 fighter jets, 14 attack and 3 transport helicopters. There are 3 destroyers, 1 cruiser, 15 corvettes, 1 oiler, 1 super aircraft carrier with 100 fighter jets, 3 attack helis and 2 transport helis, and one super battleship.
 For security at each alien outpost, there are 2 infantry battalions, 1 armored battalion, and one SFAC (special forces alien capture) battalion. In total, there are about 3,000 men, 80 tanks, and 85 armored cars/ LCT (lure, capture, transport) vehicles. 
The HQ does not have specific security divisions. It is made of a fighting force of around 1,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 (1 octilion) solders and 1,000,000,000 tanks and other vehicles. They also have 1,000,000,000 planes and 1,000,000 ships. They are also backed up by a receive force of a secret NAZI organization. We are unable to supply their statistics. :(
 
Factory System
Our factories are split into 32 sections. 24 are for the cars, 2 are for the workers, 3 are docks for receiving parts/slaves, and 3 are docks for shipping fully made cars.
Receiving parts/slaves sections:
In these three sections, there are huge docking stations for trucks, boats, planes, and space shuttles. After the parts/slaves are unloaded, they are put on huge railways to transport to the rest of the factory. Slaves are sent out of the factory and to the torture zones, then the labs, then the barracks. The parts are sent to the first 3 sections of the factory to get organized.
Car sections:
The first three sections of the factory are for unpacking and organizing the parts. They are then put on their designated conveyor belt and sent to be worked on. The next 14 sections are for the making of the engine, the body, the gear system, the axle, and many other parts. The next 2 sections are for assembling the parts made. The next 4 sections are for making the interior such as the radio, steering wheel, seats, heating, AC, antenna, mirrors, and many more parts. The last section is for assembling the rest of the parts and packing the cars. They are then sent	 to the docks by train. 
Shipping sections:
These three sections are huge docks that are exactly the same as the receiving docks. They are for shipping the cars. The cars get to them by train they are shipped off to almost all of the earth's copies. Only a few go to foreign and alien planets.
