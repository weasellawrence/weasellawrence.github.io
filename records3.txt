Buck Bear, the founder of Buckbear, had a very interesting life. His assassination in 2023 leaves us with great sorrow, but we must move on. He would have wanted us to tell his story, so here it is.

His story starts in his 20s, when he was visited by two gods, Weasel and Lawrence. You might recognize those names from our website. They gave him a katana. This katana was not ordinary. It was a reward for having achieved his high expectations for himself. This katana could create anything with metal, stretching out from the blade. After they gave him the blade, they left. Buck then made his first company, Alien Institute, and made a spaceship, extremely advanced technology and AI robots with his katana. He traveled the cosmos. You can read more about this in records 2. The part that that leaves out, is when Buck became so thirsty for his own evolution, he went to him Weasel and Lawrence. He found then on a remote planet, and killed them in their sleep. Nobody knows what happened after that, because he went alone, and when he came back, he was assassinated before he could talk.
